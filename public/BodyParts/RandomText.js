It\'s also an easier lift to control than pressing with heavy dumbbells. The exercise is easy to spot and relatively easy to learn (if not master), There are plenty of bench-press programs you can follow to increase your strength.'
,'With dumbbells, each side of your body must work independently, which recruits more stabilizer muscles; dumbbells are harder to control than a barbell. Dumbbells also allow for a longer range of motion than the barbell bench press, both at the bottom and top of the movement. Flat dumbbell presses allow you to hoist a fairly heavy weight, and they make for a good alternative if you\'ve been stuck on the barbell bench for ages.'
,'Dumbbell presses make everybody\'s top 10 list, but with an adjustable bench you can do a number of things you can\'t with a fixed bench. Our favorite: changing the angle of the incline from one set to the next, or from one workout to the next. Hitting a muscle from varying degrees of incline angles builds it more thoroughly.'
,'Many benches are fixed at a very steep angle, which requires a larger contribution from the front delts than the chest to move the weight.[2] If possible, go for a less-steep incline to hit the upper pecs without as much stress on the delts. You can also easily do low-incline benches with an adjustable bench on the Smith machine.'
,'Pick your weights and place them on your thighs as you sit on the decline bench. As you lay down on the bench, twist the dumbbells and place with on chest position. Start pressing the dumbbells in the vertical movement off the ground.'
,'Lock your legs on the decline bench. Grab the barbell on shoulder width. Slowly bring the barbell down and press it back up. Keep the movement vertical off the ground.','Get seated on the machine with handles at your mid-chest level. Press the handles forward. (Downward pushing machine)Slowly bring back the handles back towards you.'
,'Place Pullies high above your head.Put one step forward and pull your arms together and downward with moving the shoulder position. Slowly let the pulley bring back your arms.']
